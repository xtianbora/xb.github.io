                <head><h1>Printing a T-shirt using a Transfer Paper</h1></head>
                <p><b><ul>Printing designs onto T-shirts is an involved process that 
                    allows you to design your own T-shirts. 
                    While the printing methods might feel tricky at first, 
                    it should get easier once you've had some practice. 
                    Transfer printing is the best choice for a one-time 
                    project. Screen printing requires more specialized 
                    supplies but allows you to print many shirts from a 
                    single image. Inkodye is another option for quick 
                    one-time printing that's more substantial than iron on 
                    prints.</ul></b></p>

                    <li>Grab t-shirt transfer paper, scissors, a pillowcase, a clothing iron, and a t-shirt. Place the pillowcase flat on a hard surface, laying your tee on top.</li>
                    <li>Print your design on transfer paper, press it to your tee, and iron over the message for ~1 min, or as long as your paper's instructions suggest.</li>
                    <li>Or, print using an Inkodye. For this, you'll need to place a negative onto your dyed t-shirt, then lay it in the sun for ~10 minutes.</li>

                    <p><b><ul>You can use transfer paper to do dye sublimation printing, 
                        which is one of the most popular methods. Special heat transfer 
                        paper can be found anywhere you can buy stationery or printer 
                        paper. There are two types of transfer paper, one suitable for 
                        white or pastel shirts, and one suitable for all darker colors.

                <ul>
                    <li>Dye sublimation printing means printing out the image and then using heat to infuse the image onto a surface, in this case your own T-shirts.</li>
                    <li>Most transfer paper is the same size as your regular printer paper (Letter size or A4 depending on your country). Before purchasing an unusual size, make sure your printer can handle it.</li>
                    <li>Light transfer paper is used for light or white shirts</li>
                    <li>Dark transfer paper is used for any shirt that is darker.</li>
